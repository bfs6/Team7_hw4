Homework 4 - TeamName
========================================================

## `generative model`
The way I made my generative model was I first sampled my priors by the number of simulations usually some where in the millions. This is relatively fast becuase R is designed to sample distribtuions very fastly. Then I stored the distribtuion for socks, the proportion of pairs, the number of pairs and the number of odds in dataframe

I used mclapply to apply each row my the dataframe to a function to sample the draws. unlike a forloop or lapply mclapply allows me to run the code on multiple cores/tasks thus making the code much faster. 
I then add the sampled pairs and odds to the datatable and then perform approximate bayesian computution by subsetting on the desired sampled/observed data.
